thrifti
An app for finding thrift stores nearby


This app is designed to find thrift stores near the user, it will incorporate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and React Router and will pull external data from the Yelp API.

The opening page/screen will be a peek into a closet in a sepia colorway, in that Magnoloia/farmhouse/reclaime barnwood vibe...you know the one.  The font will be a bold wabi sabi type handwritting like Sue Ellen Fransisco, centered in white with the closet image as a transparent background. Tords the bottom there will be an icon of a hangar made from recycle arrows and this will be the icon at the top of all of the other pages that will bring you back to the home page.

The user will click the icon on the homepage and be magically whisked away to a page with a vintage armoire in that gorgeous beat-to-shit type vintage wood that will be a theme without, there they can search for thriftstores in their area (geolocation added time permitting).  Entering a zipcode, or city will lead the user to another page that will display a list of thrift hubs.


React components summary
-App
-Header  (on every page except the Home page)
-Zip or city search
-Store components (repeating template that will repeat with store info)
-One store per page (second repeating template provides additional info based on the selection that that the user selected on the previous page with a list of several stores)
-Default page for zips that have no thrift stores in the area (sorry...blah, blah page).

I expect challanges to present themselves when pulling data from the api, getting exactly the info that I want and also with styling, again getting it to manifest the way that I see it in my head.
